This repository contains a Node.js Express dummy data API for educational, practice, and training purposes.

## API Description
Sure! Here is a structure for a Node.js Express dummy data API with 5 endpoints:

1. Endpoint: /users
Description: Get a list of dummy user profiles with attributes such as id, name, email, and address.

2. Endpoint: /products
Description: Retrieve dummy product catalog data including products' id, name, price, and description.

3. Endpoint: /weather

You can implement mock data for each of these endpoints to simulate real data retrieval and manipulation in a Node.js Express environment.
